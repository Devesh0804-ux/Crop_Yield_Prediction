## Overview
Predict crop yield using Random Forest and weighted averaging based on region, crop type, soil type, rainfall, and temperature.

## Features
- Random Forest models with ensemble weighted averaging
- Feature encoding and train-test split
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly
- Presentation-ready notebook using RISE

## How to Run
1. Download the repository
2. Open `Crop_Yield_RF_Weighted_Visual.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells to see predictions and interactive charts
